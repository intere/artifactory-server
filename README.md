# artifactory-server
A Vagrant + Docker Artifactory Server

## Usage

Clone this repo, make sure you have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed.  Then run this from the command line:

```bash
vagrant up
```

You'll see a lot of output, and it will take a few minutes to download the VM, fire it up, provision it, and install docker, then install the docker container.

Fire up a browser, and point it to: http://localhost:8081/
Default username: **admin**
Default password: **password**

Enjoy!
